v1.3.9+5
+ (plus) [number] versions are intermediate/rolling versions where new features and changes are introduced

added:
- added debug logs in DynamicThreadPool
- added thread id to DynamicThreadPool::workers for better debug information
- added #! (shebang) in tests/test.py

fixes:
- fixed a bug where C style static array in a function is only zero initialized one time
- fixed a bug where DynamicThreadPool::shutdown is called twice

updates:
- updated CLIENT_POLLING_TIMEOUT to 50ms
- DynamicThreadPool instance is only created when THREADPOOL is defined
- DynamicThreadPool::~DynamicThreadPool now checks DynamicThreadPool::stop condition before calling DynamicThreadPool::shutdown

known issue:
- library when compiled with clang causes linking issue (macos only)
- tests might fail due to mismatch of order of keys, because of std::unordered_map

info:
- in the upcoming major version release(v2.x.x) THREADPOOL will be used as the default client handler for better performance and reliability
