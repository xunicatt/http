v1.3.9.6
<maj>.<min>.<patch>.(roll) -> versions with (roll) are intermediate/rolling versions where new features and changes are introduced until next version

changes:
- changed http::StatusCode from enum to enum class
- changed http::Server constructor to explicit
- changed http::DynamicThreadPool constructor to explicit

updates:
- updated versioning from <maj>.<min>.<patch>+<roll> to <maj>.<min>.<patch>.(roll)
- updated http::is_informational, http::is_successful, http::is_redirection, http::is_client_error, http::is_server_error and http::is_error functions to static inline functions
- updated http::json::Node::get method to inline
- updated http::json::Scanner::get method to inline
- http::Server has now two types of constructor that gets enabled based on if THREADPOOL is defined or not
- library now logs the version with "rolling" mentioned when http::Server::run is called

fixes:
- fixed http::BadRequest -> http::StatusCode::BadRequest in tests/test5
- now both CMake and Meson installed builds shows correct roll version in pkgconf

known issue:
- library when compiled with clang causes linking issue (macos only)
- tests might fail due to mismatch of order of keys, because of std::unordered_map

info:
- in the upcoming major version release(v2.x.x) THREADPOOL will be used as the default client handler for better performance and reliability
