v1.3.9.7
<maj>.<min>.<patch>.(roll) -> versions with (roll) are intermediate/rolling versions where new features and changes are introduced until next version

added:
- added new non blocking flags to socket for threadpool
- accept_thread instance is now stored in m_accept_thread member varaible
- added new check in m_accept_thread for non blocking accept
- added a new flag '-threadpool' to the 'tests/test.py' script to test threadpool version of the library
- added new 'isjson' dictionary in 'tests/test.py' script to store tests that has answers in json format

changes:
- moved http::json structures definition from 'include/types.h' -> 'include/json.h'
- changed '_' (underscore) prefix notation for private member variables to 'm_' prefix notation to avoid name collison and better readability
- changed 'trim' lambda function variable to const in 'parse_header_line' function
- lambda function to handle client in threadpool now only captures router instead of whole instance of server
- accept thread in server now explicitly requested to stop and join if joinable
- checks for error code returned by shutdown and close in server are removed to ignore unnecessary errors

updates:
- updated global static variable names with 's_' prefix notation
- updated header file 'http/http.h' -> 'http.h' in 'examples/json_with_server'

fixes:
- fixed linking issue with threadpool version of the library while testing
- fixed typo in README.md for http::HttpStatusCode -> http::StatusCode
- fixed tests might fail due to mismatch of order of keys, because of std::unordered_map

known issue:
- library when compiled with clang causes linking issue (macos only with clang++)

info:
- when linking with the library if threadpool is enabled, the user must pass -DTHREADPOOL flag to the compiler
- in the upcoming major version release(v2.x.x) THREADPOOL will be used as the default client handler for better performance and reliability
