- added new threadpool for performance improvement, which can be enable by passing THREADPOOL define ( -DTHREADPOOL )
- added #! (shebang) in tests/test.py
- added new non blocking flags to socket for threadpool
- accept_thread instance is now stored in m_accept_thread member varaible
- added new check in m_accept_thread for non blocking accept
- added a new flag '-threadpool' to the 'tests/test.py' script to test threadpool version of the library
- added new 'isjson' dictionary in 'tests/test.py' script to store tests that has answers in json format

fixes:
- fixed a BUG in json parser which allowd new lines in a json string literal

- fixed http::BadRequest -> http::StatusCode::BadRequest in tests/test5
- fixed typo in README.md for http::HttpStatusCode -> http::StatusCode
- fixed tests might fail due to mismatch of order of keys, because of std::unordered_map

changes:
- minor improvement in the overall implementation of Json Scanner (Lexer) and error handling
- minor code style and semantic changes and overall improvement
- changed http::StatusCode from enum to enum class
- changed http::Server constructor to explicit
- moved http::json structures definition from 'include/types.h' -> 'include/json.h'
- changed '_' (underscore) prefix notation for private member variables to 'm_' prefix notation to avoid name collison and better readability
- changed 'trim' lambda function variable to const in 'parse_header_line' function
- accept thread in server now explicitly requested to stop and join if joinable
- checks for error code returned by shutdown and close in server are removed to ignore unnecessary errors

updates:
- updated CLIENT_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE to 512
- updated http::Server to accept an optional argument for number of worker threads
- updated CLIENT_POLLING_TIMEOUT to 50ms
- updated http::is_informational, http::is_successful, http::is_redirection, http::is_client_error, http::is_server_error and http::is_error functions to static inline functions
- updated http::json::Node::get method to inline
- updated http::json::Scanner::get method to inline
- http::Server has now two types of constructor that gets enabled based on if THREADPOOL is defined or not

- updated global static variable names with 's_' prefix notation
- updated header file 'http/http.h' -> 'http.h' in 'examples/json_with_server'

deprecated:
- macros:
  __HTTP_VERSION_MAJ__ -> http::ver::Major
  __HTTP_VERSION_MIN__ -> http:ver::Minor
  __HTTP_VERSION_PTC__ -> http::ver::Patch

- functions:
  http::version -> http::ver::to_string

known issue:
- library when compiled with clang causes linking issue (macos only with clang++)

info:
- when linking with the library if threadpool is enabled, the user must pass -DTHREADPOOL flag to the compiler
- in the upcoming major version release(v2.x.x) THREADPOOL will be used as the default client handler for better performance and reliability
